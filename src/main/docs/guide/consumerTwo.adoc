Similarly to section 4.2 <<consumerOne>> we need to create a new consumer, but this time we will create the consumer in
the analytics application. First navigate to the analytics application

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/yourProjectLocation/initial-analytics
----

Then as before create a new consumer

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-consumer demo.BookPageView
----

Edit the generated consumer to look as follows

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/rabbit-consumers/demo/BookPageViewConsumer.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/rabbit-consumers/demo/BookPageViewConsumer.groovy[]
----
<1> Add our page view service
<2> Tell our consumer which queue to connect to
<3> Tell our consumer what to do when it receives a message. Call our custom increment action.
