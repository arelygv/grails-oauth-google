As in section 4.1 <<singleConfig>> we now need to add an additional queue to our RabbitMQ configuration.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=mqConfig]
----
<1> New `bookQueue`

In addition to updating our current app config we now need to make our first edits to our analytics app (2nd app). Our
edits will be almost the same as in section 4.1 <<singleConfig>>. Go ahead and update the analytics `build.gradle` and
`application.yml` to mirror the following.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::complete-analytics/build.gradle[indent=0, tag=mqDependencyAnalytics]
----

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=mqConfigAnalytics]
----

At this point you should notice that we have configured both our original application and the new analytics application
to both be able to see the `bookQueue`.
