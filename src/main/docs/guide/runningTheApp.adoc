At this point a test run is suggested just to make sure everything is functioning properly.

To run the application first

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

NOTE: To run the completed app `$ cd complete/` instead of `initial`.

To launch the application, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see that the default application works.

For the multi app part of this guide we will need to be able to run both apps simultaneously. To avoid a running port
conflict update your `initial-analytics` app `application.yml` to include the following.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=serverPort]
----

Now in a seperate terminal to run alongside the `initial` app

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial-analytics/
----

NOTE: To run the completed app `$ cd complete-analytics/` instead of `initial-analytics`.

To launch the application, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

The analytics app should now be running at http://localhost:8090.
Now that we have checked that both apps start, go ahead and shut them down with `Ctrl-C`.
