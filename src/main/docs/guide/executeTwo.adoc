To see our two apps communicate asynchronously using RabbitMQ we have to run both apps simultaneously. To do that open
two separate terminals. In terminal one ...

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/yourProjectLocation/initial
----

then

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

Next in terminal two ...

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/yourProjectLocation/initial-analytics
----

then

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

Now with both apps running open two browser tabs. In tab one navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see a
list of books available.

then in your second tab navigate to `http://localhost:8090/BookPageView` and you should see an empty array.

Select a book to click and after clicking you should see the book description

And if you go refresh the analytics page you will now see that book 1 has been viewed 1 time.

Try this on several books, and go back and revisit a previous book and then refresh your analytics page to see how many
views each book has.

Additionally if you view the terminal where you are running the analytics app you can see the messages it received.
