First we need to create our `BookPageView` object which will keep track of how many times a book has been viewed.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/BookPageView.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/domain/demo/BookPageView.groovy[]
----

As before create default actions for our `BookPageView` leveraging data services.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewDataService.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewDataService.groovy[]
----

Next we create our custom action that increment our book views.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewGormService.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewGormService.groovy[]
----
