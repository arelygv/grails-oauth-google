To get started we need to tell the app how to talk to the RabbitMQ we previously configured. This is actually quite simple
and very easy to do. First we need to add the dependency to support RabbitMQ ...

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0, tag=mqDependency]
----

Once we have added the dependency we can go ahead and add the necessary config to connect to RabbitMQ.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
rabbitmq:
    connections:
      - name: main //<1>
        host: localhost //<2>
        username: guest //<3>
        password: guest //<4>
    queues:
      - name: testqueue //<5>
----
<1> All connections require a name but you can name it whatever you want
<2> Where RabbitMQ is located. In this case on our local system but this can also be a web url or ip address
<3> Default username `guest`
<4> Default password `guest`
<5> Creation of a `testqueue`

Now that we have all our configuration out of the way time to create a `consumer` (ie. a receiver / user) of our messages.
